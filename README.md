> Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.

### Requirements

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Usage

1. Download docker-compose-example.yml
2. Rename docker-compose.yml
3. Open and replace the **token** environment record
4. Run with `docker-compose up -d` command
